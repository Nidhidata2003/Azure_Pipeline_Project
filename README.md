# Azure_Pipeline_Project
 This is an ETL pipeline built using Azure Services. 
 It extracts data from an on premises database to Azure Cloud through   Data Factory.
 In this we  used Azure Data Lake Gen2  as the storage solution. Also used Lakehouse Architecture .
 Transformed the data in Azure Databricks , and finally migrated to Azure Synapse Analytics , then we build a Dashboard using Power BI
